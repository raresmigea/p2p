How to run:

- go to folder in terminal
- open 2 terminals and start them with 2 different ports:
  example: `node examples/chat 1234` and `node examples/chat 4444`
- you can change the default name by running `name Jack`
- to establish the communication between terminals, run in terminal with port 1234:
  `connect 127.0.0.1:1234`
- now the messages are sent between peers
- send `pay x`
